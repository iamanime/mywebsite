                <p class="projects__description">This project I made while still in college was a clone of the app Bubble Ball which was there in the Apple Store. I didn't had an Apple device back then so I was inspired to build such a game myself after wihch I learnt Unity Game Development. The players of this game basically have to help the ball reach its destination marked by the flag. The motion of the ball was dictated by gravity as built in to the game engine. I was able to build a few levels of this game in a weekend and learned a bit of C# in the process.</p>

                <p class="projects__description">Anywhere in the world where tunnels are dug, engineers try to find out if the tunnel can sustain the load of the overburden. They do this using various commercially available softwares. I did the same using a software called Flac3D which uses the FISH programming language. I took some data out of a paper published in some journal and tried to achieve the same results using Flac3D. To my surprise the results were very close and this program written in FISH later inspired me to write other programs in different programming languages.</p>
